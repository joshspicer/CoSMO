      Linux is an operating system that sits the at core of much of the technology we interact with daily.
      Linux is free, secure, and having to work with it on the job is unavoidable.

      Join CoSMO this Monday as we demystify the linux command line!We'll start the workshop by reviewing some common and good-to-know linux commands.
      We'll then move into Bandit "War Games", an interactive shell-based game that reinforces basic commands
      and teaches security concepts.
